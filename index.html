          <h2 class="section-title">Why we built ABC Plus</h2>
          <p>
            We built ABC Plus because I noticed,
            as a substitute teacher working with students with special needs,
            that some students looked to me as if they would be able to learn their ABCs –
            they were intelligent in other ways,
            it seemed to me – but due to a lack of fine motor skills they were unable to use the alphabet programs that the other students used.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without that feedback,
            these students' learning was made more difficult.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alphabet blocks are not enough,
            because usually a teacher does not have the time to use blocks one-on-one with a student for long enough for the student to learn their letters this way –
            there are other students in the classroom who also need attention –
            and there may be behavioral issues to deal with as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            But students who have the manual dexterity to use a computer will often sit for long periods of time at a computer,
            learning from the learning programs on it that they are physically able to access.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ABC Plus learning program has been designed so that the letters can be banged on with a clenched fist,
            if that is all that a student can manage,
            and the program will say the letter. No more dexterity than that is needed.

            How you should use the ABC Plus
          </h2>
          <p class="section-text cntr-txt">
          <ol>
            <li>
              First, let the student enjoy just banging on the letters and hearing ABC Plus say the letters.
            </li>
            <li>

              Then, when you feel that the student is ready to play a little game, ask the student to press a specific letter – “press C” – and let them try to do that.
            </li>
          </ol>

<aside>
          Even trial and error can be fun, here, so don’t worry if your student is not able to do this right away.

          Just have a good time with it.

          You will know that you and your student are ready to move on when your student can spell the simple words, CAT and DOG.
